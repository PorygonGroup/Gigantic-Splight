# Gigantic-Splight

---
This project aims to simulate 3D fluids based on Taichi framework. We also provide several fun ways to interact with our scene.

## Getting Started

First, please install the requirements by

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```

Then you can run our demo by
```shell
python src/main.py
```

## Interactions

Here are the functions we built in our demo:

- `w/a/s/d`: move camera on the X-Y plain
- `space/shift`: move camera vertically
- `arrow keys`: move camera viewpoint
- `r`: reset camera to the initial position and viewpoint
- `j/k/l`: drag the fluid to one direction
- `t/y`: enable/disable board movement
- `b`: stand onto the ball!
- `m`: enable mouse viewpoint control (default: disabled)
- `p/c`: pause/continue
